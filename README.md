This is an [online Turing machine simulator](https://maximebourreau.github.io/TuringMachineSimu/) built with TypeScript, React, Redux and webpack. On opening, it provides an example machine. Unchecking the "use example" box allows you to define your own machines.
Note: Currently, user-defined machines do not support defining accepting states.
