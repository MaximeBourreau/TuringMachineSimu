This is an [online Turing machine simulator](https://maximebourreau.github.io/TuringMachineSimu/) built with TypeScript, React, Redux and webpack.

On opening, it provides an example machine. Unchecking the "use example" box allows you to define your own machines (though defining accepting states is not yet supported).
